This adds a tabbed terminal to the bottom panel in Komodo. It is powered by
butterfly.

Current state is operational but likely to contain some bugs. Only works on
Komodo 10 [and Unix systems. (Linux & OSX)](https://github.com/Defman21/komodo-terminal-butterfly/issues/1#issuecomment-221905818)

For Windows users, you should use cygwin to get this add-on working.
